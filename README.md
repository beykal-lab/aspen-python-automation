# Aspen-Plus Automation with Python

This repository demonstrates how to automate **Aspen Plus** simulations using **Python**. The goal is to enable high-throughput simulation workflows for:

- ⚙️Generating large datasets for **machine learning models**
- ⚙️ Performing **data-driven optimization**

Aspen's COM interface is used to programmatically set inputs, run simulations, and extract results — enabling thousands of simulations without manual interaction.
